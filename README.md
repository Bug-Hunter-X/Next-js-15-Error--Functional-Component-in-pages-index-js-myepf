This repository demonstrates a bug in Next.js 15 where using a functional component in the `pages/index.js` file throws an unexpected error. The bug is related to how Next.js handles functional components in the root `pages` directory, particularly when specific features or configurations are used.  This repository provides both the erroneous code and a solution to fix the problem.
